# RoomOccupiedIndicator
Code/schematics for a small project I made using the Raspberry Pi Pico to check if a room is occupied or not based on light.

Some notes: 
- The pico can also be powered via a micro USB power supply without battery. Just depending on where the breadboard is located. Schematic includes battery version, if powered via USB, just remove the battery leads from the breadboard.
- Breadboard/photo resistor has to be very close to lightsource in order for LED to light up fully.
